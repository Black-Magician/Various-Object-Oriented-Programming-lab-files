Lab 01 Review

Part #4

4.1
a) The method getCardValue() should be in the class Card.
b) The method should be in the class Card because the method returns a value
of the card itself so the method should be in the class Card so that it can 
handle its own data rather than the TwoPlayerBlackJack class handling it.

4.2
a) the methods computeHandValue() and printHandValue() should stay in the 
TwoPlayerBlackJack class because that is information that the class should handle.
b) they should be in the TwoPlayerBlackJack class because those are two fucntions that
are required in the actual game, the deck shouldn't compute that information, and the card
just has one value not a hands worth so it should be the game itself.

4.3
a)isWinner() should belong to the TwoPlayerBlackJack class, it shows the winner of the game
b)When playing the game it should tell you the winner, the game is calulating all of the scores
so it should also know the outcome of the game.

4.4
To make the game with unlimited numbers of players we would add a new class called Player.
The player class would hold the information like the hands of each of the player.
The fields would be
int bet;
DeckOfCards deck;
ArrayList<Card> hand;
boolean Dealer;
The dealer boolean would determine if the player is a dealer, if the boolean reads true then that
player is the dealer and gains the priveleges of being the dealer, after each game
the dealer will switch to the next player.
int would be asked for before the start of each game from each of the players right after they are
delt their cards.
The ArrayList would hold the hand for each player, this would also mean taking the deck from the 
game class and placing it into the player class. 
the rest of the game would work just like it has with calculating the values of each players hand
however each player will start with two cards and be asked if they want any more. the game
will automatically stop asking once the value of the players hand has either reached five, went
over twenty one, or has hit twenty one. This would be executed in a loop that will check each 
time with two if statements as well as a scanner input, this would be sure to ask if they wanted
a new card or not.
